# Elementary Celular Automaton
This is a simple implementation of an elementary celular automaton generator in rust.
Given an initial state, a rule and a number of iterations it will output an image with the visual representation of the automaton.

## How to build/run
This project uses cargo, so to run in development mode use `cargo run`.
And to generate an optimized build use `cargo build --release`.
